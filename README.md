# VueJS for beginners

## Toolchain
### Required software

#### node.js package manager (npm)
(We used version 6.x during the creation of this workshop)
```
# i.e. on Arch linux
sudo pacman -S npm

# Debian/Ubuntu etc.
sudo apt-get install npm
```

#### vue.js command line tools (vue-cli)
```
# Privileges needed because of global install (-g)
sudo npm install -g @vue/cli
```

## Getting started

# to initially create the project (choose "default" and then "NPM")
vue create playground

# to start the development server
cd playground
npm run serve
```

## What have we got so far


## Model View ViewModel (MVVM)

## One way databinding

## Event driven

## Rendering process

## Declarative/Reactive
